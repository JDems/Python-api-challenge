# Python-api-challenge

Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

In this Challenge we used citipy Library and OpenWeatherMap API to model the weather across cities. Finding their latitude and longitude we could make maps comparing many things like latitude vs humidity, tempature, cloudiness, and wind speed.



I used module 6 activities to help make the graphs, it was some copy and and paste from the ones in class but I also did use chatgpt to help with perfecting some of the graphs and syntax.
